# Overview:

This repository showcases a comprehensive end-to-end data engineering solution built on Azure. The project integrates and utilizes various Azure services to orchestrate, transform, and visualize data. The pipeline includes Azure Data Factory (ADF) for orchestration, Azure Databricks for data transformation using PySpark notebooks, Azure Synapse Analytics for data warehousing, and Power BI for visualization.

# Project Structure:

The project is organized into the following components:
Key Vault: used to manage secrets. Key Vault eliminates the need for developers to store security information in their code.
Azure storage Account: scalable, durable cloud storage, backup, and recovery solutions for any data, big or small.
Azure Data Factory (ADF): For data orchestration, workflow automation, and running Databricks notebooks.
Azure Databricks: For data processing, including bronze-to-silver and silver-to-gold transformations using Python notebooks.
Azure Synapse Analytics: For data warehousing and integration.
Power BI: For data visualization and interactive reporting.
